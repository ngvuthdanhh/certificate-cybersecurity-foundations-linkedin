# Cryptography Lab

## Objective
Understand hashing, encryption, and decryption.

## Tasks
1. Generate a SHA-256 hash of a password.
2. Encrypt and decrypt a file using symmetric encryption (AES).
3. Compare symmetric vs asymmetric encryption scenarios.

## Expected Outcome
- Hands-on experience with hashing and encryption.
- Knowledge of when to use symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography.
